##Welcome to Applicant Assessment System

This was my first web based system developed when I was a 2nd year student in my first degree. I'm still new to web applications as well as to the scripting languages PHP and Javascript. Consequently, MVC was not strictly followed in this project. :)

This Decision Support System (DSS) is intended to aid employers in hiring and selecting their applicants.

Scripting Languages: (server-side: PHP), (client-side: HTML, Javascript)
RDBMS: Mysql
